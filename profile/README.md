# MGB NeuroAI Center

Welcome to the **MGB NeuroAI Center**. An open-source portfolio of AI tools, data pipelines, and clinical research applications developed by the Mass General Brigham (MGB) NeuroAI Center team.

Our mission is to accelerate the translation of AI into real-world clinical practice by creating **transparent**, **reproducible**, and **collaborative** tools for the broader research and healthcare community.

## Areas of Focus

We build tools across the AI-for-healthcare stack:

- **Data Pipelines**: Signal, image, and EHR data ingestion and normalization.
- **ML Models**: Predictive modeling for neurological outcomes and events.
- **De-identification**: Privacy-preserving preprocessing of clinical data.
- **Visualization**: Tools for interpreting physiological and clinical time series.

## Contributing

We welcome contributions from the community!

- **Branching**: Use clear prefixes (`feature/`, `bugfix/`, `hotfix/`) and open Merge Requests (MRs) into `main` or `dev`.
- **CI/CD Pipelines**: Each push triggers automated tests and linting; ensure all checks pass before merging.
- **Code Reviews**: All MRs require review from at least one other team member.
- **Documentation**: Each repository must contain a `README.md` detailing setup, usage, and architecture.
